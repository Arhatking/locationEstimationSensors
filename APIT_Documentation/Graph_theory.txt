GRAPH THEORY
CONCEPTS OF DIRECTED GRAPH, UNDIRECTED GRAPH
UNDIRECT GRAPHS: SYMMETRY ALONG THE MAIN DIAGONAL OF THE ADJACENCY MATRIX.
(U,V) AND (V,U) REPRESENTS THE SAME EDGE, THE ADJACENCY MATRIX A OF AN
UNDIRECTED GRAPH IS ITS OWN TRANSPOSE: A=A^T. STORE ONLY THE
ENTRIES ON AND ABOVE THE DIAGONAL OF THE ADJACENCY MATRIX CUTTING THE MEMORY
NEEDED TO STORE THE GRAPH ALMOST IN HALF
WEIGHTED GRAPHS-> GIVING WEIGHTs TO THE EDGES
ADJACENCY LIST REPRESENTATION: AMOUNT OF MEMORY IS THETA(V+E)
ADJACENCY MATRIX REPRESENTATION: AMOUNT OF MEMORY IS THETA(V^2)
SIMPLICITY OF AN ADJACENCY MATRIX MAY MAKE IT PREFERABLE WHEN GRAPHS ARE REASONABLY SMALL
SEARCHING THROUGH A TREE
*BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH. SIMPLE ALGORITHMS FOR SEARCHING A GRAPH. DIJKSTRA'S SINGLE SOURCE
SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM USE A SIMILAR IDEA.
BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH SISTEMATICALLY EXPLORES THE EDGES OF G TO DISCOVER EVERY VERTEX THAT IS
REACHABLE FROM S. IT COMPUTES THE DISTANCE (SMALLEST NUMBER OF EDGES) FROM S TO EACH REACHABLE VERTEX.
IT PRODUCES A "BREADTH-FIRST TREE" WITH ROOT S THAT CONTAINS ALL REACHABLE VERTICES.
SINCE A VERTEX IS DISCOVERED AT MOST ONCE, IT HAS AT MOST ONE PARENT.
DEFINE SHORTEST-PATH DISTANCE DELTA(S,V) FROM S TO V AS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF EDGER IN ANY PATH
FROM VERTEX S TO VERTEX V.
DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH: TO SEARCH DEEPER IN THE GRAPH WHENEVER POSSIBLE. EDGES ARE EXPLORED OUT OF THE MOST
RECENTLY DISCOVERED VERTEX V THAT STILL HAS UNEXPLORED EDGES LEAVING IT. WHEN ALL OF VS EDGES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED,
THE SEARCH BACKTRACKS TO EXPLORE EDGES LEAVING THE VERTEX FROM WHICH V WAS DISCOVERED. PROCESS CONTINUES UNTIL
WE HAVE DISCOVERED ALL THE VERTICES THAT ARE REACHABLE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE VERTEX. IF ANY UNDISCOVERED
VERTICES REMAIN, THEN ONE OF THEM IS SELECTED AS A NEW SOURCE AND THE SEARCH IS REPEATED FROM THAT SOURCE.
THE PROCESS IS REPEATED UNTIL ALL VERTICES ARE DISCOVERED.
AN INTERESTING PROPERTY OF DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH IS THAT THE SEARCH CAN BE USED TO CLASSIFY THE EDGES
OF THE INPUT GRAPH G=(V,E). THIS EDGE CLASSIFICATION CAN BE USED TO GLEAN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT A GRAPH
A DIRECTED GRAPH IS ACYCLIC IF AND ONLY IF A DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH YIELDS NO BACK EDGES.
SELF LOOPS ARE CONSIDERED BACK EDGES
