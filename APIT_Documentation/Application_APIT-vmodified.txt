1.WE SHOULD COMPUTE THE LOCATION OF MANY NODES AS POSSIBLE
SINCE WE MAY HAVE HARDWARE FAILURE, THUS WE SHOULD INCREASE
THE % OF ESTIMATED NODES.
2.DO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE RECEIVER SENSITIVITY INSTEAD OF A
DEFINED DISTANCE IN ORDER TO MODEL THE NOISE (DOI)?
3. COMPUTE GRAPHS OF SCALABILITY, RESOLUTION, FAULT TOLERANCE, BANDWITH USED (FACTORS TO ANALYZE)
IN ALGORITHMS OF LOCATION ESTIMATION IN WSNs
4. COVERAGE OF A PARTICULAR AREA AND TERRAIN CAN BE SHAPED AS NEEDED TO
OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL BARRIERS OR HOLES IN THE AREA UNDER OBSERVATION
5. IN APIT + WE ARE INCREASING THE COVERAGE OF ESTIMATED NODES... SO WE ARE MAKING
MORE ROBUST THE FACT OF HAVING MORE TRAJECTORIES IN ORDER TO DEPLOY GEO-ROUTING
(WE MAY HAVE AT THE END OF THE DAY MULTIPLE PATHS TO RELAY THE INFO)
ITS ROBUST AGAINST FAULT TOLERANCE
COMPARE FAULT TOLERANCE DE APIT + VS APIT
FOR DISTASTER DETECTION... IT MAY HAPPEN THAT SOME OBSTACLES OR HOLES FORM ANISOTROPIES
IN THE NETWORK ... MAYBE NODES DEPLOYED AROUND A BUILDING, SO WE MAY HAVE MANY ESTIMATED NODES AS POSSIBLE
IN ORDER TO RELAY THE INFORMATION OF THE DISASTER TO A SOURCE... MANY MULTIPATHS ARE FORMED AND WE HAVE
TO CHOOSE THE SHORTEST ONE IN ORDER TO RELAY THE INFORMATION BACK (WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO CHOOSE
AMONG DIFFERENT PATHS).. IF WE HAVE ONLY ESTIMATED SOME NODES, FEW PATHS WOULD BE FORMED AND THEREFORE
WE COULDNT CHOOSE AS MANY PATHS AS THE FIRST SITUATION.
(COMBAT THE PROBLEM OF UNDETERMINED NODES, AVG LOCATION ERROR, MAXIMUM LOCATION ERROR AND AVOID USE
HIGH POWER ANCHORS).
APIT + -> MSGS MUST REACH THE BASE STATION IN A TIMELY AND RELIABLE MANNER.
IF WE HAVE MANY ESTIMATED NODES... EVEN WITH THE LIMITED LIFETIME OF INDIVIDUAL SENSOR NODES
WE MAY HAVE ENOUGH PATHS IN ORDER TO BRING BACK THE INFO.
DATA DELIVERY REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO RELY DATA

LINK BETWEEN THE LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM AND THE RELAY OF THE DATA
PAST APPROACHES HAVENT WORKED ON THAT (EXCEPT PAPER OF UC BERKELEY)

ADVANTAGE OF APIT (+) WE MAY USE LESS HIGH POWERED NODES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ALGORITHM

TO TEST APIT (+) Y APIT WITH A MODIFIED DOI MODEL
WE SHOULD LIMIT THE RADIO RANGE OF THE SENSORS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELIABLE MEASUREMENTS (SUCH NOISE
CAN NOT AFFECT THESE MEASUREMENTS).
SMALL AND LOW COST SENSOR NODES GENERALLY HAVE LIMITED SENSING RANGE, REQUIRING CLOSER SPACING WHICH REDUCES
TRANSMISSION POWER NEEDS (TO CONSIDER FOR THE ALGORITHM WE ARE WORKING ON!!!! WE MAY NEED TO REDUCE THE
NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE)<---
REAL-TIME REPORTING OF RESULTS TO USERS THROUGH THE LARGE NETWORK WILL INFLUENCE NODE OPERATING
SYSTEM AND NETWORK PROTOCOL CHOICES...
MAKE GRAPHS ABOUT SCALABILITY: MANY OF THE COOPERATIVE SENSING WORKS WE ENVISION WILL REQUIRE DSN SCALABLE
TO 10000 OR MORE NODES
